Little batch using Swiss File Knife (SFK) to find and delete duplicates by type ⚡⚡⚡.

It asks for the location, then the type of file and finally the extension. Option 5 allows to duplicates without regard of it's extension.

The source code of SFK tool it's included. 

The release includes a compiled sfk.exe. It's also possible to compile it from included source with the script from the author.

I did this BAT tool to isolate and personalize the use of the duplicate deleter tool budled in the great SFK.


Thanks to for SFK:
