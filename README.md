# batch-duplicate-deleter

Little batch using Swiss File Knife (SFK) to delete duplicates by type ⚡⚡⚡.

It asks for the location, then the type of file and finally the format. 

It uses SFK duplicate deleter tool. Source included here. The release includes a compiled sfk.exe. It's also possible to compile it from included source with the script from the author.

Thanks to:
